    <p>Description</p>
    <p>These milkshakes are thick, creamy, and so addictive that you’ll be trying to drink every last drop. They're the perfect
    treat for any time of the year, so here’s How to Make a Milkshake. You only need two ingredients and you can customize
    it however you’d like with as many toppings as you’d like!</p>
    <p>Ingredients</p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Ice cream –</b>full-fat ice cream will yield the creamiest and smoothest milkshake. Low-fat ice cream just isn’t the same! Choose the
        highest quality ice cream you’re able to find in stores.</li>
        <li><b>Milk –</b>use whatever milk you have at home. Just keep in mind that the higher the fat percentage of your milk, the creamier your
        milkshake will be. I use whole milk.</li>
        <li><b>Toppings –</b>take your pick on your toppings. I love adding whipped cream, sprinkles, and a cherry.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>steps to create this recipe</p>
